Adapters


The StarTech DK30CH2DPPD has an HDMI  and 2 DisplayPort ports on 
the back for triple displays.  Need adapters to get hooked up
to 3x 24" displays.

I like the looks of the CableMatters brand available off amazon.

NOTE: Think I have the 3 cables already (nice):

o Using 6' CableMatters DisplayPort to DVI cable for 
  one of the 24" ASUS diplays.

o Using CableMatters USBC to DVI adapter and 6' DVI cable
  for 2nd 24" ASUS display.  Figure this could be used to 
  connect the 24" Dell in triple display configuration.
 
o Have another 6' CableMatters DisplayPort to DVI cable
  in file cabinet.  Figure this could be used to connect
  the 2nd 24" ASUS display in triple display configuration.
